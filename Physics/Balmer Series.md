$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{4}{364.56\ \text{nm}} \left( \frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{k^2} \right)
\quad\quad \text{where } k = 3, 4, 5,\ \dots
$$
Formula for the wavelengths of the visible Hydrogen Line [[Spectral Lines|Spectra]] in nanometers

Really we should use the [[Bohr Model#Bohr Reduced Mass of Electron|Reduced Mass of the Electron]] to calculate this, if we want to be even more exact, as the nucleus does not have infinite mass, and therefore wobbles due to the pull of its orbital electrons.
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R(M) \left( \frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{k^2} \right)
\quad\quad \text{where } k = 3, 4, 5,\ \dots
$$
$$
R(M) = \frac{\mu_{e}}{m_{e}} R_{\infty} = \frac{1}{1+\frac{m_{e}}{M}} R_{infty}
\quad\quad \text{where }\ \mu_{e} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{m_{e}}+\frac{1}{M}}
$$
