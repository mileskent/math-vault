Electromagnetic oscillators can only have certain discrete energies: $E_{n} = nh\nu$. The oscillars can absorb or emit energy in discrete multiples (quanta) of the fundamental quantum energy given by:
$$
\Delta E = h\nu = \hbar \omega
$$

Based on this he perfectly models [[Blackbody Radiation]]
$$
S(\lambda, T) = \frac{2\pi c^2h}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/\lambda kT} - 1}
$$
where $h$ is the [[Planck constant]]
