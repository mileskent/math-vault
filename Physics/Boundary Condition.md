Boundary Conditions determine which wavelengths can occur
In all wave problems a differential [[Wave Equation]] what shapes the waves could have
#### 1 Dimension
* e.g. the ends of a guitar string
* waves with a Boundary Condition have discrete frequencies: 
	* $\lambda(k) = \frac{2L}{k \in \mathbb{N^+}}$
	* Fundamental $\lambda_{0} = 2L$

#### 2 Dimensions
* e.g. a drum has a circular Boundary Condition
$$
f(x, y) \propto \sin(k_{x}x) \sin{(k_{y}y)})
$$
