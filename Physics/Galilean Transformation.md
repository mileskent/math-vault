Given reference frames $K$ and $K'$
1. Parallel Axes
2. Any two [[Inertial Reference Frame]]s are related by, at most one velocity
		(Let $K'$ have constant relative velocity $v_{\text{frame}}$ WLOG in the x direction , wrt $K$)
3. Time for all observers is the same

$$
\begin{align*}
x' &= x - v_{\text{frame}} t\\
y' &= y\\
z' &= z\\
t' &= t
\end{align*}
$$
$$
x'_{t} = x_{t} - v_{\text{frame}} \quad v' = v - v_{\text{frame}}
$$
Vectorized relative transformation follows same idea.
Can also calculate the inverse transformation easily.

Is at odds with [[Maxwell's Equations]]
