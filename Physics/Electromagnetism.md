The concept relating electric and magnetic fields together into a singular entity.
Can be described in terms of [[Maxwell's Equations]].

Moving electric fields create magnetic fields (like in the [[Biot-Savart Law]]) and changing magnetic fields induce electric fields (like in [[Faraday's Law]]).

Can be conceptualized entirely as [[Special Relativity|Relativistic]] [[Electrostatics]], due to [[Lorentz Transformation|Lorentz Transformations]]
