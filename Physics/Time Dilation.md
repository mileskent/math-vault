The shortest measurement for an event is always shortest for a stationary observer at the location of the event -> [[Proper Time]].
* Very related to [[Length Contraction]]
* 2 Trains on different routes, i.e. Northbound vs Southbound: 
	* the clock on the wall in your own cabin is always proper time because your clock is stationary from your reference point. 
	* Meanwhile, the clock in the train that is passing you is never proper time because it's moving from your perspective and thus its time is dilated.
	* From the perspective of a passenger on the other train, they view the situation reciprocally, where their clock is proper time and yours is dilated
	* Neither observer's frame is preferred and therefore both perspectives are different
	* To be clear only *relative* velocity is important here

From [[Lorentz Transformation]]
$$
\Delta t' = \gamma \left( \Delta t - \frac{v \Delta x}{c^2} \right)
$$

> [!tip] Why dilation?
> $K$ is the stationary reference frame, while $K'$ is the one is relative motion.
>We want the time from the moving observer in $K'$ in terms of the [[Proper Time]]

> T' = \gamma\ T_{0}

> where $T_{0}$ is the [[Proper Time]] of a stationary observer of position $x$
> $T'$ is the time measured by moving observers of position $x'$
> $\Delta x = 0$ because the stationary observer is not moving. 
> This results in $T'$ being a dilated version of the proper time, as $\gamma \geq 1$
