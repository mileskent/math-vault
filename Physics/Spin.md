Particles act as though they are spinning and have angular momentum due to this. However, they do not actually spin in a classical manner, and it is a purely [[Quantum Mechanics|Quantum Mechanical]] property. The number indicates what amount of a rotation results in the object ending up in its original orientation, e.g. the [[Electron]] with spin of $\frac{1}{2}$ requires half a rotation before ending up in its original orientation.

Spin can be treated kind of like [[Operator#Angular Momentum Operator|angular momentum]] except we use $S$ and $m_s$ instead of $L$ and $m_l$
$$
|\vec{S}| = \sqrt{ s(s+1)  }\ \hbar
$$
$$
S_{z} = m_{s} \hbar
$$
$$
m_{s} = \pm \frac{1}{2}
$$
where positive $\frac{1}{2}$ is [[Up]] and negative $\frac{1}{2}$ is [[Down]]
