of the [[Atom]]
1. Electrons reside in *stationary states* and do *not* radiate energy. They have well-defined energies: $E_{n}$ where $n \in\mathbb{Z}^+$
	Transitions can occur between them yielding light of energy: $E = E_{n} - E_{n'} = h \nu$
	where $E_{n} < E_{n'}$ is aborption and $E_{n} > E_{n'}$ is emission
2. Classical laws of physics don't apply to transistions between stationary states, but they do apply elsewhere
3. The angular momentum of the $n^{\text{th}}$ state is $n \hbar$, where $n$ is call the *Principal Quantum Number*

#### Consequences
$$
L = mvr = n\hbar
\quad \implies \quad
v_{\text{electron}} = \frac{n\hbar}{mr}
$$
$v_{\text{electron}} = \frac{e}{\sqrt{ 4\pi \epsilon_{0}mr }}$ from planetary model
Set equal to eachother you get
$$
r_{n} = n^2 a_{0}
\quad
\text{where}\ a_{0} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar^2}{me^2}
$$
$a_{0}$ is called the [[Bohr Radius]], which is the radius of the Hydrogen atom in its lowest energy state.

More specifically 
$$
(v_{\text{electron}})_{n} = \frac{n\hbar}{mr_{n}} = \frac{1}{n} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_{0} \hbar} = \frac{1}{n}\ c\ \alpha
$$
See [[Fine Structure Constant]]

Emission of light occurs when the atom is in an excited state and decays to a lower energy state ($n_u \rightarrow n_{l}$)
$$
h \nu = E_{u} - E_{l}
$$
where $\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted photon

Can be used to derive the [[Rydberg Equation]]

#### Limits
Assumes that the nucleus has infinite mass. In reality, the nucleus wobbles with the motion of the [[Electron]]. In order to account for this motion, use the reduced mass of the electron
###### Bohr Reduced Mass of Electron
$$
\mu_{e} = \frac{{m_{e}}}{1 + \frac{m_{e}}{M_n}} = \frac{m_{e}M_{n}}{m_{e} + M_{n}}
$$
**Only works for Hydrogen atoms and other single electron atoms**

Doesn't explain other natural phenomena
