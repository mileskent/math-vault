An N-dimensional matrix that operates on N vectors to yield a number. N is also called the *rank*.
A matrix is 2 dimensional, i.e. N = 2
A vector is 1 dimensional, i.e. N = 1
A scalar is 0 dimensional, i.e. N = 0

The number of subscripts on a tensor indicates the rank.
e.g. for [[General Relativity#Spacetime Metric]], both tensors have two subscripts and are therefore tensors of rank 2.
