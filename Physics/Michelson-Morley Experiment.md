#### Conclusion
Aether doesn't exist.
Differences in theoretical measurements fail to account for [[Length Contraction]]
Also explained by [[Special Relativity]]
#### The Experiment

An experiment to measure the velocity of the Earth relative to "aether", the apparent medium of [[Light]] through space, hypothesized at the time. Aether does not exist, and the experiment proved this. Light does not in fact require a medium.
The experiment used [[Michelson Interferometer]]
If light required a medium then its velocity would depend on the velocity of the aether medium. The total velocity would be given be the vector sum of the light's velocity and the medium vector.  
Let $c$ be the [[Speed of Light]] and $v$ be the aether velocity
#### As they Theorized
The [[Delay]]s of the parallel and perpindicular progations would be as follows
$$
T_{||} = \frac{2L}{c} \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\quad
T_{\perp} = \frac{2L}{c} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$
Thus, the fringe [[Phase Delay]] would be
$$
\Delta \phi = \omega \tau = \omega (T_{||} - T_{\perp})
$$
They would then rotate the device and remeasure which would give
$$
2 \omega (T_{||} - T_{\perp}) \approx 2 \omega \frac{ 2L}{c} \left( 1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2} + 1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2}\right) = \frac{4\pi L}{\lambda} \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.2 \text{ rad}
$$
#### Experimental Results
The interference fringes showed no change as the interferometer was rotated, repeatedly reproducing null results over a long period of time.
