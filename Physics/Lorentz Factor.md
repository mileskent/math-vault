The Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is defined as
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$$
$$\frac{1}{\gamma} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}$$

where:
* $v$ is the relative velocity between inertial reference frames,
* $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]] in vacuum,
* $\beta$ is the ratio of $v$ to $c$,
