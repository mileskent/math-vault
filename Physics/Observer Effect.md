Observing a [[Quantum Mechanics|Quantum]] particle changes its state because we are smacking it with a [[Photon]] or interacting with it in some other way such that it loses its original state. 
### [[Operator#Angular Momentum Operator|Angular Momentum]]
For example [[Operator#Angular Momentum Operator|angular momentum]] would be changed through observation. We can only know the z component. However, which direction we call z is arbitrary. What happens if we call some direction z and then redefine z to be our old x? Redefining the z as the old x and remeasuring affects the particle in its measurement, rendering the original z measurement no longer correct. Unless $l = 0$ because $L = 0$
$$
\Delta L_{x} \Delta L_{y} \geq \frac{|m_{l}|\hbar^2}{2}
$$

### [[Spin]]
Same as angular momentum, just the [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum]] version.
$$
\Delta S_{x} \Delta S_{y} \geq \frac{|m_{s}|\hbar^2}{2}
$$
