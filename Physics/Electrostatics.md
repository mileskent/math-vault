1. As you may know, matter is made of atoms. Atoms have a nucleus, which is made up of [[Proton|protons]] (positive) and [[Neutron|neutrons]] (neutral), and [[Electron|electrons]] (negative). Opposite charges are attracted to one another with a inverse square force, and like charges are similarly repelled.
2. The [^1]electrons in conductors are able to move freely, while in insulators they cannot unless they come off entirely
3. Some materials tend to give off electrons (e.g. fur) and some tend to attract them (e.g. plastic)
4. Not all metals are conductors
5. A neutral object can be attracted to a charged object via *induced polarity*. In a conductor, this means the electrons move through the entire object to create a dipole. In an insulator, the electrons of the atoms realign to create billions of on tiny dipoles. This makes a difference due to the inverse square law, which will be discussed further later. The former creates a strong attraction, while the latter creates a weak attraction.

[^1]: Not all of the electrons in a conductor can move, it’s just
	that the ones that don’t move can be ignored because they do
	not contribute to the net charge of a material
