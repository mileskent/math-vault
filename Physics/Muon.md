> [!NOTE]  Cosmic Ray Muons are an experimental verification of [[Special Relativity]]. 
Muons are produced in the upper atompshere in colluision betweren ultra high energy cosmic ray particles and air molecule nuclei. But they decay (lifetime = 1.52 $\mu s$) on their way to the earth's surface, with an average velocity of 98% of the [[Speed of Light]]. Because they are travelling so fast [[Special Relativity|Relativistic Effects]] are measureable due to the fact that they penetrate the atmosphere deeper than classical physics would predict. Without [[Time Dilation]], we expect 45 muons in theory. The experiment shows 542 muons which agrees with the prediction of 538 by [[Special Relativity]]. From the perspective of the muon, the earth is moving with a speed of .98c. It will see the distance it travels as a [[Length Contraction]]. Thus, in both reference frames the result is the same. In one reference frame, time dilates, and in the other length contracts.
