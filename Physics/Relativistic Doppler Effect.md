Supposed that a light source 
* emits $N$ waves during the proper time interval $T_{0}'$, which is the time observed from the moving light source
* For $T_{0}'$ in the light source's frame, the stationary observer experiences coordinate time $T$
($T = \gamma\ T_{0}'$ from [[Lorentz Transformation]])
$$
N = \nu_{0}T_{0}' = \frac{\nu_{0}T}{\gamma} \quad\quad \text{where } \nu_{0} \text{ is the source frequency}
$$

In the stationary observer's frame
$$
\text{Wave Propogation Distance(T)} = cT + \text{v}T 
$$
$$
\lambda = \frac{cT + \text{v}T}{N} \quad \implies \quad \nu = \frac{cN}{cT+\text{v}T} 
=
\dots
=  \nu_{0} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{v}{c}}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}}
$$
$$
\nu = \frac{cN}{cT+\text{v}T} 
= \nu_{0} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{v}{c}}{1 + \frac{v}{c}}}
= \nu_{0} \frac{\sqrt{1- \frac{\text{v}^2}{c^2} }}{1 + \cos(\theta)\frac{v}{c}}
\approx \left(\nu_{0} \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\text{v}^2}{c^2}}{1 + \cos(\theta)\frac{v}{c}} \quad \theta \not \approx 90^{\circ},\ \text{v} \not \approx c \right)
$$
* Use $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ as > 0 when the source and receiver are receding from each other (red shift to lower frequency \[this is the current signs for $\beta$\])
* Use $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$ as < 0 when the source and receiver are approaching each other (blue shift to higher frequency)
