With [[Fraunhofer Diffraction]]
$t(x)$ is defined as follows

or from the front of the surface:

$$
t(x) = \text{rect}\left( \frac{x+a}{w} \right) + \text{rect}\left( \frac{x-a}{w} \right)
$$
$$
E(k_{x}) \propto \mathcal{F}(t(x)) \propto \text{sinc}\left( \frac{w\left( \frac{kx'}{z} \right)}{2} \right) \exp\left(ia\left( \frac{kx'}{z} \right) \right)
+
\text{sinc}\left( \frac{w\left( \frac{kx'}{z} \right)}{2} \right) \exp\left(-ia\left( \frac{kx'}{z} \right) \right)
$$
$$
E(x') \propto \text{sinc}\left( \frac{wkx'}{2z} \right) \cos\left( \frac{akx'}{z} \right)
$$

#### Snakes
Snakes are somewhat wavelike, and it turns out that they exhibit some behavior of waves, like [[Diffraction]]
