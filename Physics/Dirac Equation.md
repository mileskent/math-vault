$$
\left(
\beta mc^2 + \sum^3_{j = 1} \alpha_{j}p_{j}c
\right)
\vec{\Psi}(x, y, z, t) = i \hbar \frac{\partial\vec{\Psi}(x, y, z, t)}{\partial t}
$$
where
* $\vec{\Psi}$ is a complex four dimensionnal wave-function vector
* $p_{j}$ are momentum operators in the Schodinger theory
* $\alpha_{j}$ and $\beta$ are specialized 4x4 matrices
