$$
a_{0} = \frac{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar^2}{m_{e}e^2} = \frac{\hbar}{m_{e}c \alpha} = 5.2946551599\times10^{-11} \text{ m}
$$
where 
* $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permitivity of free space
* $\hbar$ is the [[Planck constant#Reduced Planck Constant]]
* $m_{e}$ is the mass of an [[Electron]]
* $e$ is the [[Elementary Charge]]
* $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
* $\alpha$ is the [[Fine Structure Constant]]
