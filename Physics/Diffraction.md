Diffraction is the energy-conserving deviation of [[Wave]]s due to interaction with an obstacle.

#### Common Observation
This effect is the most prominent with [[Plane Wave]]s, which are emitted from [[Laser]]s, and also are approximated by distant point sources (which would emit [[Spherical Wave]]s).  
[[Diffraction#Ocean Waves|Ocean Waves]] are also approximately plane waves, which is why the effect is prominent there too.
The reason why we do not observe diffraction more in everyday life is because most light sources do not emit plane waves.
#### Edge Diffraction
Or that they bend around corners. This is called [[Edge Diffraction]]

#### Ocean Waves
*Intuition is very helpful*

#### Uncertainty
Any [[Fourier Transform]] implies the [[Scale Theorem]] implies the [[Uncertainty Principle]].
[[Fraunhofer Diffraction]] uses the [[Fourier Transform]]. 
Therefore, [[Fraunhofer Diffraction]] implies the [[Uncertainty Principle]].
Specifically, in the case of 1 slit, an uncertainty principle between:
* The slit width 
	* $\Delta x$
* The diffraction pattern width
	* $\Delta k_{x}$
$$
\Delta x \Delta k_{x} \geq \textasciitilde1 \quad \text{OR} \quad \Delta x \Delta x' \geq \textasciitilde \frac{z}{k}
$$
$\therefore$ The smaller the slit, the larger the diffraction angle and the bigger the diffraction pattern
