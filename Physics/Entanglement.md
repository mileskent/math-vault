For a system with more than one particle, we often write the complete state as the product of two [[Dirac Notation|kets]], one for each particle. 
For example, if particle $A$ has $+\frac{1}{2}$ spin, and particle $B$ has $-\frac{1}{2}$ spin, we'd write
$$
\Psi = 
|\uparrow\rangle_{A}
|\downarrow\rangle_{B}
$$
where A has spin [[Up]] and B has spin [[Down]]
Often, we don't know which is up and which is down so we write the system as a *superposition*, which reflects the uncertainty of the system. The expression reflects the probability of each possibility.
The particles are *entangles*
$$
\Psi = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ {2} }}|\uparrow\rangle_{A}
|\downarrow\rangle_{B}
+
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}|\downarrow\rangle_{A}
|\uparrow\rangle_{B}
$$
There isn't a real mathematical description of describing this state, so we just label each one, e.g. up and down.
