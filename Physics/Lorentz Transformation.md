A modification of [[Galilean Transformation|Galilean Transformations]] which accounts for [[Special Relativity]]
$$
\begin{align}
x' = \gamma (x - vt) & \quad\quad x = \gamma (x' - vt') \\
y' = y & \quad\quad y' = y\\
z' = z & \quad\quad z' = z\\
t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{vx}{c^2} \right)& \quad\quad 
t = \gamma \left( t' - \frac{vx'}{c^2} \right)\\
\end{align}
$$
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\frac{v^2}{c^2} }} \quad\quad (\gamma \in \mathbb{R})\geq 1
$$

Implies that ordering of events depends on the observer

### [[Time Dilation]] vs [[Length Contraction]]
1. Why is a reference frame that is moving relative to a stationary observer
	Dilated (multiplied) by $\gamma$ for time, but contracted (divided) by $\gamma$ for length?

	Each measurement involves its own special conditions.
	* Time
		* $x_{2}=x_{1}$
		* $x_{2}' \not = x_{1}'$
		* Must use [[Lorentz Transformation]]
	* Length
		* $t_{1}'=t_{2}'$
		* $t_{1} \not = t_{2}$  
			* (really they could be anything, but they don't strictly need to be equal)
		* Must use [[Lorentz Transformation|Inverse Lorentz Transformation]]

2. Related?
	Due to the symmetrical nature of [[Special Relativity]], from one frame, there is [[Time Dilation]], but from the other there is [[Length Contraction]]. Therefore, they are two ways of describing the same effect

### Relativistic Velocity Addition
Note that it's impossible to achieve the [[Speed of Light]]

* Particle interactions that emit [[Photon|Photons]] do not affect the speed of the photons, which is constant at the [[Speed of Light]]
