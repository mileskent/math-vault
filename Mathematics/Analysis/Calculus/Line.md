# Vector Equation
$$
l(t) = \underbrace  {\vec{OP}}_{\text{Position vector on line}} + t \underbrace{\vec{v}}_{\text{Vector || line}},\ t \in \mathbb{R}
$$
> [!warning]
> Must include domain of variable, in this case "$t \in \mathbb{R}$"

Here $P$ is a point on the line in question, and $\vec{OP}$ is used to denote a position vector from the origin to point $P$
