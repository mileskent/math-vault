A sum of the terms of an arithmetic [[Sequence]], which is a list of [[Number]]s with a constant difference.

If the first and last number of the sequence are known, the sum $S_{n}$ up to the $n^\text{th}$ term is the following:
$$
S_{n} = \frac{n(a_{1} + a_{n})}{2}
$$
If the first number and the constant difference are known, then the sum $S_{n}$ is the following:
$$
S_{n} = \frac{n}{2}(2a_{1} + (n-1)d)
$$
