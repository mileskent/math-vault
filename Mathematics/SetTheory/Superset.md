A [[Set]] encompassing/extending another set; Set B is a subset of A.
* A superset is the converse of a [[Subset]]. They are defined the same way, but the operands are swapped.
* Exclusively using subsets is favored
# Definition
$$
B \supseteq A \iff \forall x\ (x \in A \implies x \in B)
$$
# Proper Superset
$$
B \supset A \equiv B \subseteq A \land B \neq A
$$
