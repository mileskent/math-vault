A [[Open Systems Interconnection Model#Data Link Layer]] [[Networking Device]] serving as a central [[Network Node|Node]] for at least two other nodes. A switch improved on a [[Bridge]]'s capabilities by providing more ports to connect more devices.

A switch cannot communicate across [[Subnet]]s without a [[Router]]
