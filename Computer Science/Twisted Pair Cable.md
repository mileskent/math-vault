# Straight-Through Cable
a TP segment using either ANSI/TIA-568A or ANSI/TIA-568B at both ends. A straight-through cable is used to connect dissimilar devices. Ex: A PC connected to a switch uses a straight-through cable.

# Crossover Cable
a TP segment using ANSI/TIA-568A at one end and ANSI/TIA-568B at the other end. A crossover cable is used to connect similar devices. Ex: a switch connected to another switch uses a crossover cable to interconnect the switches.

# Rollover Cable
a TP segment with opposite pin assignments on each end of the cable. A rollover cable is also known as a console cable. A rollover cable is used to access a device's interface or console. A console port allows the connecting device to make configuration changes.
