 A [[Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm]]
* [[Greedy Algorithm]]
* Very similar to [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]] as it is looking for the shortest [[Weight]] from one vertex to its [[Adjacent]] vertices. 
	* Both of them
		* Have start vertex
		* Store seen vertices in minHeap
		* At each step mark a vertex as visited, and add its neighbors to heap
	* Dijkstra's 
		* assigns priority based on distance from start vertex
		* returns a [[Shortest Path Algorithm|shortest path]]
	* Prim's
		* assigns priority based on distance from current node to the next [[Greedy Algorithm|greedy]] vertex
		* returns a [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]
* Focuses on [[Connected]] [[Graph]]s
* Builds the [[Minimum Spanning Tree]] one [[Vertex]] at a time
* If a graph is not connected, what is generated is a *Minimum Spanning Forest*

> [!info]- More Info - Graph Cut 
Let's address the [[Graph Cut]] property. Conceptually, the algorithm refers to a cut property across the edges in a graph. The cut property of MSTs states that  any MST must include the minimum cost edge over any graph cut . The entire basis for why Prim's algorithm works is this property! Prim's algorithm maintains a set of visited vertices, which are the vertices connected by the MST at that specific point in the progression of the algorithm.

This visited set implicitly creates a graph cut between visited vertices and unvisited vertices. The edges in the priority queue (the "frontier" is what we called it in Dijkstra's) are precisely the edges in this graph cut, and the priority queue will of course give us the minimum cost edge.
### Efficiency
$$
O(|E| \log |E|)
$$
for the same reasons as [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
* If the graph is [[Dense]], then $O(|E| \log |E|)$
* If the graph is [[Sparse]], then $O(|V| \log |V|)$
### Implementation
* Visited [[Set]] to track where we have been
* [[Heap]] of [[Edge]]s with shortest distance to another vertex
	* The next edge in the heap represents the shortest edge to take next
* Edges of minimum [[Weight]] that are traversed are stored in an MST Edge Set
* `for all neighbors of Edge(u, w) not in VS` is the same as saying for all edges leaving the [[Graph Cut]]

prims(start: Vertex) {
	VS: Set<Vertex>, MST: Set<Edge>, h: minHeap<Edge>
	VS.add(start), h.add(start.edges)
	
	while (h and VS < G) {
		edge(from: Vertex, to: Vertex) = h.poll()
		if (to !in VS) {
			VS.add(to)
			MST.add( edge(from, to) )
			for to.edges: edge(to, x) st x not in VS {
				h.add(edge(to, x))
			}
		}
	}

	return MST < 2*(V - 1) ? null : MST
}
