A nonlinear [[Data Structure]] which consists of a set of *vertices* (nodes) connected by *edges* where the edges may be directed or undirected.
* If the same vertices are connected in the same way by edges, the graphs are the same; it doesn't matter how you draw the graph so long as it satifies the aforementioned condition

### Graph ADT Methods
* `vertices()` returns iteration of all vertices
* `edges()` returns iteration of all edges
* `numVertices()` returns count of all vertices
* `numEdges()` returns count of all edges
* `endVertices(e: Edge)` returns endpoint vertices of given edge
* `getEdge(u: Vertex, v: Vertex)` returns edge from u to v or else null
* `numEdges(v: Vertex)` returns iteration of all outgoing edges to v
* `opposite(v: Vertex, e: Edge)` returns the other vertexx u that is incident to v for edge e
* `insertVertex(d: Value)` create a return new vertex with value d
* `insertEdge(u: Vertex, v: Vertex, e: Edge)` create a return new Edge e from vertex u to v
* `removeVertex(v: Vertex)` removes vertex v and all incident edges for v from the graph
* `removeEdge(e: Edge)` removes edge e from the graph
### Graph Representation Data Structures
##### Adjacency Matrix
Like a [stochastic matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix).
Undirected graphs always result in symmetrical matrices.
Rows are coming out of that vertex, Columns are arriving at that vertex

Works well for a dense graph. Works well if you need to represent weights.
Does not work well for adding vertices because you have to copy everything over. 
##### Adjacency List
[[HashMap]] with external chaining where the size of the map is the size of the graph.

Works well when the graph is sparse.
##### Edge List

Doesn't work for disconnected vertices.
