A distributed database of "Root Nameservers" that is used for [[Domain]] to [[IP|IP Address]] translation.
There is also Reverse DNS where the IP is queried in reverse order of its octets: e.g. [https://dns.google/resolve?name=8.5.207.130.in-addr.arpa](https://dns.google/resolve?name=8.5.207.130.in-addr.arpa)
