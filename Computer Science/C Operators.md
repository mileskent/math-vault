### Miscellaneous Operators
Apart from the above operators, there are some other operators available in C used to perform some specific tasks. Some of them are discussed here: 

###### sizeof
```
sizeof (operand)
```
- A **compile-time** unary operator which can be used to compute the size of its operand.
- The result of sizeof is of the unsigned integral type which is usually denoted by size_t.
- Basically, the sizeof the operator is used to compute the size of the variable or datatype.

###### comma
```
operand1 , operand2
```
- The comma operator (represented by the token) is a binary operator that evaluates its first operand and discards the result, it then evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type).
- The comma operator has the lowest precedence of any C operator.
- Comma acts as both operator and separator. 

###### ternary/conditional
```
operand1 ? operand2 : operand3;
```
- The conditional operator is the only ternary operator in C++.
- Here, Expression1 is the condition to be evaluated. If the condition(Expression1) is __True__ then we will execute and return the result of Expression2 otherwise if the condition(Expression1) is __false__ then we will execute and return the result of Expression3.
- We may replace the use of if..else statements with conditional operators.

###### member operators
```
structure_variable . member;
```
and
```
structure_pointer -> member // same as (*structure_pointer).member
```

- Member operators are used to reference individual members of classes, structures, and unions.
- The dot operator is applied to the actual object. 
- The arrow operator is used with a pointer to an object.

##### cast
```
(new_type) operand;
```

- Casting operators convert one data type to another. For example, int(2.2000) would return 2.
- A cast is a special operator that forces one data type to be converted into another. 
###### pointer address of and dereference
```
&variable
```
and
```
*address
```
- Pointer operator & returns the address of a variable. For example &a; will give the actual address of the variable.
- The dereference operator * has the opposite effect. For example \*p will give the value that the pointer p points to. In a [[C Variable Management#Declaration|declaration]], it indicates that a variable is a pointer.
