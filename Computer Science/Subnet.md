A subnet, or subnetwork, is a smaller network within a larger network that helps improve efficiency and manageability.
The subnet is given by the [[Network]] part of the [[IP]] and the [[Host]] on that subnet is given by the remaining bits of the IP.
# Subnet Mask
Let's say the subnet mask is 26 bits long. You can notate this as
\<IP\> 255.255.255.192
\<IP\>/26
The [[Network]] part is the first 26 bits and the [[Host]] part is the remaining 6 bits of the [[IP]].
