A protocol stack is a layered collection of communication protocols that work together to enable data exchange between devices in a network. Each layer in the stack has a specific function and relies on the layers below it to provide services, creating a structured approach to network communication.

A protocol stack can handle:
* Arbitrary Message Sizes -> [[Packet Switched Network]]
* Out of order delivery -> Sequence Number
* Packet Loss -> ACK and buffers
* Bit Errors -> [[Checksum]]
* Queueing delays

[[Open Systems Interconnection Model|OSI Model]] is a protocol stack.
