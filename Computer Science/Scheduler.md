Scheduler is responsible for scheduling many [[Process|processes]]. This is called scheduling. 
![[Pasted image 20250927150123.png|400]]
Who gets to use the Processor at any given moment? Different processes will have different priorities. There are also properties enforced by system policies that affect the decision.
It is usually implemented in [[C]], unlike the [[Dispatcher]] which is usually in [[Assembly]]

# Long Term Scheduler
Determine whether a [[Program]] should be turned into a [[Process]].
"Do I have the resources to finish you?"
# Medium Term Scheduler
Deals with processes that already exist.
"Can I let you run efficiently? Should I put you on the backburner to let other more efficient processes finish first?"
Concerned with orchestrating [[Memory Pressure]] & [[Multiprogramming#Goldilocks Multiprogramming]]
Avoids [[#Thrashing]] and constant [[Page Fault]]ing, i.e. ideal CPU utilization, minimal bottlenecking
# Short Term Scheduler
We already know we have enough resources to go around.
"Who gets to run next?"
The scheduler's job is to order the ready queue.

# CPU Burst
Continuous CPU Activity by a process before requiring an I/O operation
# I/O Burst 
Activity initiated by the CPU on an I/O device
# Ready Queue
Queue of PCBs that represent the set of memory resident processes that are ready to run on the CPU
# I/O Queue
Queue of PCBs that represent the set of memory resident processes that are waiting for some I/O operation either to be initiated or completed
# Thrashing
A phenomenon wherin the dynamic memory usage of the processes current in the [[#Ready Queue]] exceed the total memory capacity of the system. The system's resources have been overcommitted. The [[#Medium Term Scheduler]] would get involved and evict some [[Process Control Block|PCB]]s out of the Ready Queue.

# Metrics
![[Pasted image 20250927155958.png]]
where $w_{i}, e_{i}, t_{i}$ are respectively the [[#Wait Time]], [[Performance#Execution Time]], and [[#Turnaround Time]] (elapsed time) for a job $j_{i}$
## Throughput
Jobs per second
## Execution Time
How long did this job stay on the CPU during its execution?
## Turnaround Time
How long did this job take to complete after being requested?
### Average Turnaround Time
Average the turnaround times
## Wait Time
How long did this job remain idle after being requested?
### Average Wait Time
Average the wait times
## Response Time
The turnaround time, but from a user centric perspective.
## CPU Utilization
Percentage of time the CPU is busy
## Starvation
User-centric metric that signfies denial of service to a particular process or set of processes due to some intrinsic property of the scheduler.
E.g. I put in a long job, and all my friends are spamming short jobs; [[#Shortest Job First]]
## Convoy Effect
User-centric metric that results in a detrimental effect to some set of processes due to some intrinc property of the scheduler.
E.g. I put in a long job, and all of my friends with short jobs have to wait; [[#First Come First Serve]]
