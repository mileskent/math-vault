a 16-bit unsigned number that uniquely identifies a [[Network]] application or service on a host. Port addresses are included in a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] header to associate a [[Payload]] with a specific process or service. Using a distinct port for each process or service allows a single device to simultaneously recognize multiple traffic types. Ex: A device can simultaneously receive website traffic and email traffic because each service is associated with a unique port.

# Source Port
Source ports are generally chosen by the [[IP]] stack to be unique among all open conenctions (usually [[#Ephemeral]])
So each open connection has a unique ordered quad, allowing connections to be kept separate even though the IPs, and destination port are the same. 
FYI each host here is keeping track of 4 sequence numbers. See [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]
