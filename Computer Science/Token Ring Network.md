But the [[Physical Topology]] is usually a [[Physical Topology#Star Topology]]

The network has a token which can be acquired to allow a device to send data. If a device has acquired the token, the device puts its data in the token and also marks the token as in use. The token continues to circulate throughout the network. It is kind of reminscient of [[Mutex]]es in terms of the mutually exclusive access, and the idea of acquiring and releasing.
