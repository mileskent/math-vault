An issue that occurs in multithreading with improper usage of synchronization primitives where multiple threads “race” such that whichever “finishes” first results in a different outcome. The “race” is unpredictable, so sometimes one thread with “win” and sometimes another thread will “win”. The result is multithreaded code that has unpredictable behavior.
