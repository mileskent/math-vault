# 3 Macrostates of LC3
## [[Fetch]]
3 Clock Cycles
Gets the next instruction from [[Memory]] and puts it in the [[Instruction Register]]
## [[Decode]]
Is like a dictionary for how to do an [[Instruction]]
The [[Opcode]] actually goes into a [[Decoder]], which chooses the relevant instruction to be performed.
## [[Execute]] Runs the instruction.
# [[Memory]]
* $2^{16}$ memory locations from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF
* $16$ bits per [[Word]]
* Instructions start at 0x3000,
	* Recall typical [[orig]] in LC3 Instructions
