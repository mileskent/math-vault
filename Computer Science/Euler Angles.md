A way of representing the orientation of a body in 3d space, using 3 angles. Each angle is rotation about one of the coordinate axes. The orientation is equivalent to performing each rotation in succession. The order absolutely matters. 
* Has an issue called Gimbal Lock
* Has issues with interpolation between angles
# Conventional Orders of Rotation
## Tait-Bryan
* The aerospace convention
* Z, Y, X
* Yaw, Pitch, Roll
## Proper Euler
* The physics convention
* Z, X, Z
