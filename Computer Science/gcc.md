# Optimization
*We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we shuold not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%* - Knuth
## Basic Optimization
### Constant Folding
Evaluates expressions at compile time and replace them with their constant values
### Constant Propagation
Replaces variables with their constant values wherever possible
### Common Subexpression Elimination
Identifies and elimminates redundant calculations by resuing the result of a previous calculation
### Dead Code Elimination
Removes code that has no effect on the program's output
## Loop Optimizations
### Loop Unrolling
Copies the loop body multiple times to reduce loop overhead and improve performance
### Loop Invariant Code Motion
Move calculations that are independent of the loop counter outside the loop
### Loop Fusion
combines adjacent loops that operate on the same data
### Loop Fission
Splits a loop into multiple loops to enable further optimizations

## Function Optimizations
### Function Inlining
See [[C Function#`inline`]]
### Tail Call Optimization
Optimizes tail recursive calls to avoid stack frame allocation
## Advanced Optimizations
### Instruction Scheduling
### Strength Reduction
Replaces rexpensive operations with cheaper equivalents
### Vectorization
Uses SIMD instructions to perform operations on multiple data elements simulatenously
### Profile Guided Optimization
Uses runtime profiling data to optimize code for real-world execution scenarios
### Interprocedural Optimization
Optimizes across functionboundaries such as [[C Function#`inline`|inlining]] across files or optimizing based on the call graph
# Flags
