$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \text{div}\ \vec{F}
$$
* How much a flow will either diverge from or compress to a point
* Positive means divergent, source, spout
* Negative means compressing, sink, drain
* 0 means that the flow is incompressible, and that there is an equal amount of flow entering and exiting the point
* Uses [[Del]] operator
* $\text{div}\ (\text{curl}\ \vec{F}) = 0$
