Suppose $\vec{T}(u, v)$ is a [[Linear Transformation#1-1]], [[Differentiable]] [[Transformation]] that maps the [[Region]] $G$ in the $uv$ plane to the region $R$ in the $xy$ plane. Then:
$$
\iint_{R} f(x,y)\ dx\ dy = \iint_{G} f(\vec{T}(u, v))\ \det\left(J_{\vec{T}}\right) \ du\ dv
$$
where $\det J_{\vec{T}}$ is the [[Jacobian#Jacobian Determinant]] of $\vec{T}(u, v)$
