A sum of the terms of a geometric [[Sequence]], which is a list of [[Number]]s where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the "Common Ratio", denoted by $r$.

If the first term $a_{1}$ and the common ratio $r$ are known, the sum $S_{n}$ of the first $n$ terms is the following:
$$
\begin{gathered}
S_{n} = \frac{a_{1}(1 - r^{n})}{1 - r}\\
\text{for }r \neq 1
\end{gathered}
$$

If $r = 1$, then the elements of the sequence do not change, so the sum $S_{n}$ is simply: 
$$
S_{n} = n \cdot a_{1}
$$

If $|r| < 1$ the sum $S_{\infty}$ as $n$ approaches infinity is the following:
$$
S_{\infty} = \frac{a_{1}}{1 - r}
$$
