Let $E$ be a [[Region#Simple]] Solid. 

Let the surface $S$ be the boundary surface enclosing $E$, with outward orientation.

Let the vector field $\vec{F}$  have continous partial derivatives on the open region that contains $E$

$$
\iint_{S} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{S} = \iiint_{E} \nabla \cdot \vec{F}\ dV
$$
* [[Surface Integral#Vector Surface Integral]] equal [[Triple Integral]] of the [[Divergence]]
* "Blow a bubble around $E$ in the shape of $S$, and it will tell you how much the inside of the bubble wants to run away"
