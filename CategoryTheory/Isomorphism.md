A [[Bijective]] [[Homomorphism]].
An *Isomorphism* is when there exists [[Transformation#Bijective]] [[Morphism]] between a pair of [[Mathematical Object|Objects]]; a relationship where one object can be converted and restored to and from another object, without destroying information or properties of the sets.

If $A$ is an isomorphism of $B$, then $A \cong B$

* For example, as [[Vector Space]]s: $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$ (not as [[Algebraic Field]]s though)
