An *Isomorphism* is when there exists [[Transformation#Bijective]] relationship between a pair of [[Mathematical Object|Objects]]; a relationship where one object can be converted and restored to and from another object, without destroying information.

If $A$ is an isomorphism of $B$, then $A \cong B$

For example, $\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$
