an [[algebraic structure]] that has less [[axiom]]s than a [[group]] because it doesn't require an [[inverse]]
# axioms
1. [[closure]]: $a, b \in g \implies ab \in g$
2. [[associativity]]: $a, b, c \in g \implies (ab)c = a(bc)$
3. [[identity]]: $\exists\ i \text{ s.t. } \forall a \in g,\ ia = ai = a$
