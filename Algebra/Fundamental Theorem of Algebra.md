An $n^{\text{th}}$ degree [[Polynomial]] has exactly $n$ [[Complex Number|complex]] roots (including multiplicity).
* Complex roots come in [[Complex Number#Complex Conjugate]] pairs
	* If $x \in \mathbb{C}$ is a root of a polynomial, then so is $\bar{x}$
	* For $y \in \mathbb{C}$, $\overline{(\text{Re}\ y)} =\text{Re}\ y$, hence [[Real Number]]s do not come in pairs because the "complex conjugate" of a real number is itself.

# Complex Eigenstuff
Complex roots coming in complex conjugate pairs implies that complex [[Eigenstuff#Eigenvalue]]s and their [[Eigenstuff#Eigenvector]]s come in complex conjugate pairs. This is because eigenvalues are the solutions to the [[Characteristic Equation]], which is a [[Polynomial]] equation.
