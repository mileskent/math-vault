# Linear Independence
The only solution to  $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$ is the trivial $\vec{0}$ $\iff$ Linearly Independent
## Geometric Interpretation
If two vectors are linearly independent, the are not colinear
If 3, then not coplanal
If 4, not cospacial
# Linear Dependence
* Any of the vectors in the set are a linear combination of the others
* If there is a free variable, so there are infinite solutions to the homogenous equation
* If the columns of A are in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and there are $n$ basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is always true), then if the amount of columns in A exceeds the amount of basis vectors that exist in that dimension, it means that there are free variables, which indicates linear dependence
* If one or more of the columns of A is $\vec{0}$
* Iff $\det A = 0 \iff A \text{ is Singular}$
