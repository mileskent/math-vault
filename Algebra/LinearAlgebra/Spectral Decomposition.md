# Symmetric
Recall: If P is an orthogonal n × n matrix, then P −1 = P T , which
implies A = PDP^T is diagonalizable and symmetric.
## Spectral Thm
An n × n symmetric matrix A has the following properties.
1. All eigenvalues of A are real.
2. The dimenison of each eigenspace is full, that it’s dimension is equal to it’s algebraic multiplicity.
3. The eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal.
4. A can be diagonalized: A = PDP^T , where D is diagonal and P is orthogonal.
