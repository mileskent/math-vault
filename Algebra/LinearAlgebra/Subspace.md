A [[Vector Space]]'s version of a [[Subset]], with some constraints.

A subset $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace if it is closed within scalar multiplication and vector addition, i.e. if
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{For}\ c \in \mathbb{R},\ \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in H\\
c \vec{u} \in H\\
\vec{u} + \vec{v} \in H\\
\vec{0} \in H
\end{gathered}
$$

# Properties
* $\text{span}\ H = H$, i.e. the [[Span]] of any subset is identical to itself
