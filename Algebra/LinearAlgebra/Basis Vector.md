A [[Vector]] that an element of a [[Basis]] for a [[Vector Space]], which is a [[Set]] of [[Linear Independence|Linearly Indepedent]] whose [[Linear Combination]]s can represent any vector in that space.
# Standard Basis Vector
Standard basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that have a one entry for each dimension, and zeros for the rest, 
* e.g. for $\mathbb{R}^3$:  $\vec{e_1}, \vec{e_2}, \vec{e_3} = \hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$
* You could choose any basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ so long as it is linearly independent, but the standard basis for a dimension is the most convienient one
