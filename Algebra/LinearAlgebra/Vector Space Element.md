Note that [[Vector]]s need not be $n \times 1$. Any possible element of a vector space is by definition, a vector. This means that vector spaces really contain [[Tensor]]s. 99% of the time when people are talking about vectors, they really mean "Coordinate vector", i.e. a vector that represents a location in [[Space]]. Whereas a vector represents a location in a [[Vector Space]].
