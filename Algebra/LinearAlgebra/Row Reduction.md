# Consistent
A linear system is considered ***consistent*** if it has $>=1$ solution(s)
## Theorem for Consistency
> A linear system is *consistent* iff the last
> column of the augmented matrix does not have a pivot. This is
> the same as saying that the RREF of the augmented matrix does
> not have a row of the form $[0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ ...\ |\ 1]$ 
> 
> Moreover, if a linear system is consistent, then it has
> **1. a unique solution iff there are no free variables.**
> **2. infinitely many solutions that are parameterized by free variables**
