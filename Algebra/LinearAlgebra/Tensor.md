A potentially hyperdimensional rectangular hyperprism of [[Number]]s. Tensor Rank is the number of indices required to address all locations in the tensor.

| Object         | Tensor Rank |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| [[Scalar]]     | 0           |
| [[Vector]]     | 1           |
| [[Matrix]]     | 2           |
| Order-N Tensor | 3+          |
