The dimension of a [[Subspace]] $H$ is the [[Cardinality]] of its [[Basis]] $\mathcal{B}$
$$
\dim H = |\mathcal{B}|
$$

> [!important] $\dim \{ \vec{0} \}$
> $$
> \dim {\vec{0}} = 0
> $$
> This is because a basis requires a [[Set]] of [[Linear Independence|Linearly Indepedent]] [[Vector]]s, and $\vec{0}$ does not meet this requirement. Therefore, its only basis is $\emptyset$. The cardinality of the empty set is 0, therefore so is $\dim \vec{0}$
# Examples
* dim $\mathbb{R}^n$
	* $n$
* dim(Nul A) is the number of 
	* number of free vars of A
* dim(Col A) is the number of 
	* number of pivots of A
* H = $\{(x_1 ...., x_n) : x_1 + ... + x_n = 0\}$
	* n variables, solve for $x_1$ ito everything else. -> one pivot everything else free vars. Therefore $n - 1$ free vars
