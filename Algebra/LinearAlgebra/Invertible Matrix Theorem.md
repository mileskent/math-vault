Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. These statements are all equivalent
* $A$ is [[Matrix#Invertible]]
* $A^T$ is invertible.
* $A$ is [[Row Equivalent]] to $I_n$.
* $A$ has $n$ [[Echelon Form#Pivot]]s
* $A \vec{x} = 0$ has only the trivial solution, i.e. $\vec{x} = 0$
* The columns of A are [[Linear Independence|Linearly Indepedent]].
* A is [[Bijective]]
* The equation $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a solution $\forall \ \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
* $\text{span\ }\text{col}\ A = \mathbb{R}^n$
* $A$ has a left inverse
* A has a right inverse
- 0 is not an [[Eigenstuff#Eigenvalue]] of A
- $\det A \not = 0$
