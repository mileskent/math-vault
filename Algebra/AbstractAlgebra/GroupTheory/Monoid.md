An [[Algebraic Structure]] that has less [[Axiom]]s than a [[Group]] because it doesn't require an [[Inverse]]
# Axioms
1. [[Closure]]: $a, b \in g \implies ab \in g$
2. [[Associativity]]: $a, b, c \in g \implies (ab)c = a(bc)$
3. [[Identity]]: $\exists\ i \text{ s.t. } \forall a \in g,\ ia = ai = a$
