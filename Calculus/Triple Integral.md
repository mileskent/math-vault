An integral over 3 variables.
$$
\iiint_{E} f(\vec{x})\ dV
$$
# Cartesian
$$
\iiint_{E} f(x, y, z)\ dx\ dy\ dz
$$
where $x$ is the amount a point lies in the positive $x$ direction
where $y$ is the amount a point lies in the positive $y$ direction
where $z$ is the amount a point lies in the positive $z$ direction
# Cylindrical
[[Polar Coordinates]] + $z$
$$
\iiint_{E} f(r, \theta, z)\cdot r\ dr\ d\theta\ dz
$$
where the [[Jacobian#Jacobian Determinant]] $\det J_{f} = r$
where $r$ is the distance of a point's $xy$ [[Projection]] from the origin
where $\theta$ is the angle of the point from the positive $x$ axis
where $z$ is the amount a point lies in the positive $z$ direction
# Spherical
$$
\iiint_{E} f(\rho, \theta, \phi)\cdot \rho^2\sin(\phi)\ dr\ d\theta\ dz
$$
where the [[Jacobian#Jacobian Determinant]] $\det J_{f} = \rho^2 \sin(\phi)$
where $\rho$ is the distance of a point from the origin
where $\theta$ is the angle of the point from the positive $x$ axis
where $\phi$ is the angle of the point from the positive $z$ axis
