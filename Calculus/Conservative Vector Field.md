$$
\vec{F} = \nabla f
$$
$$
\int_{C} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = 0\quad \forall \text{ closed paths}
$$
All conservative vector fields have [[#Independence of Path]]
# Independence of Path
Normally, if $C_{1}$ and $C_2$ have the same endpoints, then $\int_{C_{1}} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} \not =\int_{C_{2}} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r}$

Only under independence of path would the two integral be equal.

# Proving Conservativeness
1. $\vec{F} = <P,Q>$ is a vector field on an open, simply-connected [[Region]]
2. $P,Q$ all have continuous first order [[Partial Derivative]]s
3. $P_{y} = Q_{x}$ throughout the region
