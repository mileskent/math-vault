z = |z|e^{i\phi} = |z| (\cos(\phi) + i \sin(\phi))

z_1 z_2 = (|z_1|e^{i\phi_1})(|z_2|e^{i\phi_2}) = (|z_1||z_2|e^{i(\phi_1 + \phi_2)})

* Consequence of [[Euler's Identity]]
* Suppose $z_1$ has an angle $\phi_1$ and $z_2$ has $\phi_2$
* The product $z_1 z_2$ has angle $\phi_1 + \phi_2$, and modulus $|z_1||z_2|$
