Green's Theorem equates
* An area of a fence ([[Line Integral]])
* A volume under a surface (Double Integral)
Let $\vec{F} = \langle P, Q\rangle$
$$
\oint_{C} Pdx + Qdy = \oint \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = \iint_{D} Q_{x} - P_{y}\ dA

$$
$C$ must be positively-oriented, meaning that $D$ is on the left hand side when walking the curve. This is simply just because if it were negative oriented, the sign of the [[Line Integral]] would flip.
