Let surface $S$ be an oriented, piecewise-smooth surface bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve $C$, that is positively oriented.

Let $\vec{F}$ be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an open region in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that contains $S$

$$
\int_{C} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} = \iint_{S} (\nabla  \times \vec{F}) \cdot d \vec{S}
