A [[Plane]] that is tangent to a Surface.
# Level Surface
When the surface in question $S$ is given by $F(x, y, z) = k$, and there is a point on the surface $P(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$
$\nabla F(P)$ is normal to the surface at the point $P$
Therefore, we have been supplied a normal vector and a point, so we have enough information to create a plane.
