$$
\nabla \times \vec{F} = \text{curl}\ \vec{F}
$$
1. Vector that shows swirliness and rotation direction
2. Swirliness based on magnitude of curl
3. Rotation direction about the axis of the vector, according to [[Right Hand Rule]]

* Uses [[Del]] operator
* if $\vec{F}$ is [[Conservative Vector Field|Conservative]], then $\nabla \times \vec{F} = \vec{0}$
	* $\implies$ if $\nabla \times  \vec{F} \neq 0$, then $\vec{F}$ is not conservative
* if the domain of $\vec{F}$ is [[Region#Simply-Connected]]
	* then $\vec{F}$ is [[Conservative Vector Field|Conservative]] iff $\nabla \times \vec{F} = \vec{0}$
