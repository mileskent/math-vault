# Plane Equations
$$
ax + by + cz = d
$$
$$
a(x - x_{0}) + b(y - y_{0}) + c(z - z_{0}) = 0
$$
where $\langle x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0} \rangle$ is a point in the plane
where $\langle a, b, c \rangle = \vec{n}$ is normal to the plane

# Determining the Plane
A plane can be determined by
1. 3 points in  $\mathbb{R}^3$
2. A point & 2 [[Linear Algebra#Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] vectors $||$ to the plane
3. Linear Equation: e.g. $3x - 2y + z = 4$
4. A point & a normal vector $\vec{n}$

> [!tip]
> * The normal vector of a plane and the plane's equation are bidirectionally derivable
> * $✈️_{A}\ ||\ ✈️_{B} \iff \vec{n}_{A}\ ||\  \vec{n}_{B}$
